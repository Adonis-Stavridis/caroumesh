You can import it by passing it as a [`SceneObject`](https://github.com/Adonis-Stavridis/caroumesh/tree/main/src/lib/components/Scene/Scene.types.ts). You can use both types in the same array.\\n\\n```tsx\\n<Caroumesh\\n  scenes={[\\n    {\\n      src: 'assets/StarDestroyer.gltf',\\n      scale: 0.5,\\n      position: new Vector3(0.5, 0.25, -0.5),\\n    },\\n    'assets/TieFighter.gltf',\\n  ]}\\n/>\\n```\\n\\nThe [`SceneObject`](https://github.com/Adonis-Stavridis/caroumesh/tree/main/src/lib/components/Scene/Scene.types.ts) accepts the following props:\\n\\n```ts\\n{\\n  /** Source path to scene file */\\n  src: string;\\n  /** Cast and receive shadows */\\n  shadows?: boolean;\\n  /** Control intensity of lights in scene */\\n  lightIntensity?: number;\\n  /** Rotation speed of scene: set this to `0` to disable rotation */\\n  rotationSpeed?: number;\\n} & {\\n  position?: Vector3;\\n  up?: Vector3;\\n  scale?: number | Vector3;\\n  rotation?: Euler;\\n  matrix?: Matrix4;\\n  quaternion?: Quaternion;\\n}\\n```\\n\\n> ‚ö†Ô∏è Adding too many scenes might affect performance. You can use the\\n> `stats` prop to analyze impact on the component's FPS (cf [#stats](#stats))\\n\\n#### Optimizing scenes\\n\\nGenerally, 3D scenes and meshes are can be quite heavy, so to reduce load\\nas much as possible it is recommended you compress your models into glb\\nfiles with draco compression. You can run the following command to compress\\neach gltf/glb file you have.\\n\\n```bash\\nyarn scene:optimize model.gltf\\n```\\n\\n> ‚ÑπÔ∏è This creates a new gltf file at the same location as the input file\\n> using [the Draco compression library](https://github.com/google/draco)\\n\\nIf you want more customization over the arguments, use `yarn scene`\\n(see [gltf-pipeline CLI documentation](https://github.com/CesiumGS/gltf-pipeline#using-gltf-pipeline-as-a-command-line-tool)\\nto learn more about the arguments you can use). For example:\\n\\n```bash\\nyarn scene -i model.gltf -b\\n```\\n\\n### Dimensions\\n\\nBy default, the component will take all available space of the parent's space.\\nYou can manually set the dimensions using the `dimensions` prop.\\n\\n```tsx\\n<Caroumesh\\n  ...\\n  dimensions={[750, 500]}\\n  ...\\n/>\\n```\\n\\n### Lights\\n\\nThe component comes by default with a three point light setup.\\n\\nYou can modify this setup by changing the props of the lights using the\\n`lights: { keyLight, fillLight, backLight }` prop.\\n\\nYou can also display the lights' gizmos (visual helpers to see what area is affected by a light)\\nusing the `lights: { helpers }` prop.\\n\\nIf you want to setup your own light setup you can use the `lights: { customLights }` prop.\\n\\n```tsx\\n<Caroumesh\\n  ...\\n  lights={{\\n    customLights: <spotLight position={new Vector3(4, 2, 4)} />\\n  }}\\n  ...\\n/>\\n```\\n\\nThis prop accepts a `ReactNode` of\\n[react-three-fiber](https://threejs.org/docs/#api/en/lights/AmbientLight) light\\ncomponents. These are all the possible light components you can use:\\n\\n```html\\n<ambientLight />\\n<directionalLight />\\n<hemisphereLight />\\n<pointLight />\\n<rectAreaLight />\\n<spotLight />\\n```\\n\\nYou can find the\\n[documentation](https://threejs.org/docs/index.html?q=light#api/en/lights/Light)\\nof [three.js](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js), for more information about\\nthese components.\\n\\n### Controls\\n\\nYou can enable enhanced controls over the scenes using the `controls` prop.\\nYou can use the following key-binds on your mouse and keyboard to control the scene:\\n\\n| Key-bind                          | Action     |\\n| --------------------------------- | ---------- |\\n| Mouse Left (Hold)                 | Rotate     |\\n| Shift or Ctrl + Mouse Left (Hold) | Pan        |\\n| Scroll wheel                      | Zoom       |\\n| Space                             | Reset view |\\n\\nThe view resets every time you switch to a new scene.\\n\\n### Stats\\n\\n> **_\\\"If it works on my computer, then it's all good!\\\"_**\\n\\nWhile developing, you can use the `stats` prop to evaluate performance\\nand check how adding models or lights may affect your FPS.\\n\\n> ‚ö†Ô∏è It's suggested to enable this prop only when developing, for\\n> debugging purposes, and disable it when deploying to production.\\n>\\n> ‚ÑπÔ∏è The FPS of the component depends on the workstation it is being run on.\\n> So performance will vary between different computers.\\n> Also, FPS might be lower when running on a phone.\\n\\nIn general, good performance would be an average of ~60 FPS, when switching scenes\\nand also when holding idle on scenes.\\n\\nIf you have more than 60 FPS, then you probably have a \\\"better than average\\\" workstation,\\nso don't be fooled into overloaded the scenes with high-poly meshes, lots of lights, and effects.\\nYou might be able to run it, but maybe not the average user.\\n\\nIf you have anything less than 50-60 FPS, then you either:\\n\\n- have scenes that are very heavy (lots of polygons or lights usually)\\n  - [Optimizing your scenes](#optimizing-scenes) might help\\n  - Use a 3D editing software (such as [Blender](https://www.blender.org) üß°) to simplify mesh and remove any components\\n    that could be heavy on the load (lights for example)\\n- have added too many scenes into the Caroumesh\\n  - same suggestions as previous bullet points\\n  - Remove any scene you deem optional\\n  - Remove any scene that could be heavy\\n- are rerendering the Caroumesh several times\\n  - the props you are passing could be changing\\n  - memoize props passed to Caroumesh with `React.useMemo`\\n  - fix the parent components of Caroumesh from updating too much\\n  - memoize your Caroumesh component with `React.memo` so that it only rerenders when necessary\\n- are using a browser with locked FPS\\n  - not sure if you can change this, you should look it up\\n- Caroumesh is buggy or is built poorly üò≥\\n  - [create an issue](https://github.com/Adonis-Stavridis/caroumesh/issues/new)\\n    about your use case\\n  - [create a pull request](https://github.com/Adonis-Stavridis/caroumesh/compare) to fix this\\n    darn thing\\n- if you are certain that all the above are not the reason of poor performance, and FPS is so\\n  low, Caroumesh is barely useable, then you probably own a \\\"potato computer\\\" ü•î\\n  - getting a better computer ü§∑\\n\\n## Upcoming releases\\n\\nThe next releases may present the following features:\\n\\n- Display visual indicator of position of current scene and the surrounding ones.\\n- Display textual information for each model (title and description)\\n\\nFor any feature requests,\\n[create an issue](https://github.com/Adonis-Stavridis/caroumesh/issues/new) or feel free to\\n[create a pull request](https://github.com/Adonis-Stavridis/caroumesh/compare) and\\ncontribute to the project! :trollface:\\n\\n## Contributing\\n\\n1.
